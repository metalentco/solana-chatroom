# Usage

## Create Account

The first time you visit the site, it will make you `Connect Wallet`.

Then, it will require create the profile.

It requires `avatar`, `userId` and `userName`.

The created profile will represent you in chatroom, you know, this profile will be chatroom account.

Right after submitting `Save` button, it will store your profile on firestore as well as calling the server side API to create the token(access token to messaging app).

This token will be also stored on firestore according to your connected wallet address.

Your unique id is your wallet address in firestore, on the other hand, your typed id will be your identifier in messaging app.

Of courase, website will check typed id is duplicated or is already taken by other users.

## Register Collection

It means that you register collection.

At the same time, you will create the channel which allows only your collection NFT holders get in.

Right after clicking `Register Collection`, it will show modal to type `Contract Address` and `Collection Name`.

Of course, website will check `Contract Address` is vaild or not.

Also it will check `Collection Name` is unique or is already taken by other collections.

Because this `Collection Name` will be name of your channel as well as identifier of your channel.

## Get in Channel

Right after registering channel, you can see your channel if you hold the specific NFT in your wallet now.

If not, you can't see any channels.

I already created two channels according to ERC721A and ERC1155 contracts he made for `AsyncPlayground`.

You can purchase the NFT in [Playground](https://asyncplayground.vercel.app/).

ERC1155 is public sale now and ERC721A requires whitelist due to be a pre-sale.

After purchasing the NFT, please refresh the website then you can find the specific channel according to purchased NFT's collection.

Let's Enjoy.
